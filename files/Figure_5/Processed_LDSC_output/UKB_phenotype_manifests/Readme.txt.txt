These manifests contain all the phenotypes for which we performed cell type specific enrichments.
Please note that the sources for these phenotypes are different for practical reasons.

Continuous traits were retrieved from the NealeV3 UKB phewas

All phenotypes that we use investigated are in the Keep_category row of the continuous traits manifest. 
These choises were based on phenotype power and whether interpretation is relatively non-cryptic given the cell types in the dataset.


Binary traits and the control continuous trait were retrieved from the pan-UKB phewas:
